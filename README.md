# React-Components-Insta-Clone

## Composing React Components and Passing Data Via Props

### **Introduction**

- For this project, you'll be building a simple Instagram clone using React.
- There is a file provided called `dummy-data.js` that contains some mock data. Each object in the mock data represents a faux Instagram post.
- Your React application will receive faux post data and render each as a separate Instagram post.

### **Objectives**

### **Project Setup**

This project was put together using create-react-app (CRA). You will not need to install CRA in order to make this project work. Follow the steps below to setup the project with the proper dependencies.

- [ ]  Create a forked copy of this project.
- [ ]  Add your team lead as collaborator on Github.
- [ ]  Clone your OWN version of the repository in your terminal
- [ ]  CD into the project base directory `cd React-Components-Insta-Clone`
- [ ]  Download project dependencies by running one of these two commands `yarn` or `npm install`
- [ ]  Using the same command tool (yarn or npm) start up the app using `yarn start` or `npm start`
- [ ]  Create a new branch: git checkout -b `<firstName-lastName>`. Implement the project on your newly created `<firstName-lastName>` branch, committing changes regularly.
- [ ]  Push commits: git push origin `<firstName-lastName>`.

### **Tasks**

- [ ]  This app can be broken down to two main sections that you'll need to implement for this project: the Search Bar and the Posts.
- [ ]  To complete this project there will be a single instance of the Search Bar being rendered at the top of the page, as well as a Post Container and a Comment Section for every piece of mock data in the `dummy-data.js` file.
- [ ]  Use what you learned yesterday to add and update state for the likes so that when you click on the heart icon it updates the number of likes.
- [ ]  Look through the code before you start. There are a lot of files. Not all of them need code added to them. 
Start in the App.js file and read the instructions there. 
- [ ]  you'll want to add your own styles via CSS. To keep things organized, have the CSS file that corresponds with a component live in the same directory as the component file.

Your search bar header should look something like this:

---

Your posts should look something like this:
![insta post](/assets/ig_post.png)


### Stretch Goals

- [ ]  Create more dummy data in the dummy-data.js file and add search functionality to the search bar. One way to do this is with a filter method.
- [ ]  Implement the ability to comment on a post with the `Add a comment...` input.
- [ ]  Finish styling all of the application and get your instagram clone to closely resemble the given design spec.
